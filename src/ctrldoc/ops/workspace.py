"""L2.5 workspace primitive — CRUD facade over the SQLite store.

A `Workspace` is a typed collection of doc-graphs that shares one
concept lattice (§6.7). `WorkspaceManager` is the small read/write
seam every callsite — CLI, Python API, MCP server — goes through to
create one, attach docs, list them, and inspect the shared lattice.
Heavy state (concepts, claims, cross-doc edges) lives in
`SQLiteStore`; the manager is the unit of API stability.

The id is content-derived (`ws-<sha256(name)[:16]>`) so the same name
yields the same id across processes — a property the verdict ledger
(§6.5) depends on for replay determinism. Name uniqueness is enforced
both here (clearer error message) and at the SQL layer (`UNIQUE`
constraint, defense in depth).

`WorkspaceInfo` is the read-only view `workspace info <name>` returns:
the underlying `Workspace`, the document count, and the size of the
shared concept lattice slice — the count of `Concept` rows whose
`doc_ids` intersect the workspace's member docs. Richer per-doc
breakdowns land alongside cross-doc edges (S-135).
